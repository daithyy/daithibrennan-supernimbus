## üõ†Ô∏è Getting started
# Testing the Game with a Live Server
Before we move further, check that you have the server details quick to hand. We will use this to connect two running game client instances from any machine.

- Download the latest release found in the [releases](https://github.com/daithyy/daithibrennan-supernimbus/releases) section.

- Once you have downloaded the **.zip**, extract the contents under any location. We will only be testing with the Unity **windows_build_game** that serves as the game client.

- Inside **windows_build_game** folder, [allow the TestProject.exe Unity game through your firewall](https://pureinfotech.com/allow-apps-firewall-windows-10/).

- Run two instances of the **TestProject.exe** game.

- Carry out the following steps for both game clients: 

1. Under **Unity Game Server** and **Nakama**, add correct public server IP address found in my email. The ports should remain the same.

2. Under **Login**, input user credentials. A display name, valid email with **@.com** and **ensure your password is longer than 8 characters!**

Example User:

```
Name: Daithy
Email: test@daithy.com
Password: test12345
```

> Ensure the user email is different for both game clients or this will cause an error!

3. Click **Register** for both clients, if you have received a success message; you have registered with the Nakama server.

4. Click **Connect** for both clients, this will start the Nakama matchmaking and will find a match for both players.

5. You should see a successful Nakama validation message in the chat on connection to the Unity game server.
